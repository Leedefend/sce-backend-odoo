CODEX PREAMBLE v1.0

Stage: <P0/P1/P2/P3>

Hard prohibitions:
- Do not edit on main branch.
- Do not create new DB names; only sc_demo/sc_p2/sc_p3 unless explicitly allowed.
- Do not commit docs/audit/*.csv (restore after gate runs).

Required evidence:
- branch + sha
- git show --name-status -1
- gate tails (tp08 / p2.smoke / p3.smoke / p3.audit as required)
- at least one script output
- git status clean
