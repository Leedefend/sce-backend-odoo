- Branch: `feature/security-product-history-customer-payload-closure`
- Starting product commit: `28d453420371b1a92f3401551834f32866955540`
- Formal Product Layer: P4 operations delivery governance
- Layer Target: product payload boundary, build/release defaults, and CI gates
- Module: repository-wide delivery tooling; no customer module is embedded
- Reason: remove customer payload from the public product tree and prevent reintroduction
- Standard vs User-Specific: generic product guard only; customer facts remain external
- Why Here: the public product repository owns its build and release boundary
- Why Not Elsewhere: a private customer module cannot enforce the public repository boundary
- Blast Radius: tracked payload paths, product/demo defaults, Docker context, release defaults, and CI
